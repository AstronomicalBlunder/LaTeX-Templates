## Notes Template
A template for writing up expository mathematics. It has several varied colored environments and is spaced to allow for easy reading, skimming and reference.

## Pset Template
Main two environments is a box for the pset question and a shaded solution environment, with the goal of making writing up the solution (and grading it) easier.

## CV Template
This is the template I use for my own CV. It is suited more for academic than professional purposes, with some custom sections for talks, research projects and skills. It was adapted from the CVs of [Robin Truax](truax.io)  and [Ben Church](https://web.stanford.edu/~bvchurch/).
